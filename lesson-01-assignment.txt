Question 1:

Commands are as followed: 

$student_ids = Enrollment.where(course_id: 5).limit(2).pluck(:student_id)
$student_emails = Student.where(id:[first_student_id, second_student_id]).pluck(:email)
$student_ids.each_with_index do |student_id, index|
   student_email = student_emails[index]
   puts "<#{student_id}>, <#{student_email}>"
  end


Question 2:
Commands are as followed: 

$nilGrades =  Enrollment.where(course_id: 5, final_grade: nil).limit(2).pluck(:id)
$mentor_ids = MentorEnrollmentAssignment.where(enrollment_id:[ nilGrades[0], nilGrades[1]]).pluck(:mentor_id)
$mentor_emails = Mentor.where(id: [mentor_ids[0], mentor_ids[1]]).pluck(:email)
$mentor_ids.each_with_index do |mentor_id, index|
   mentor_email = mentor_emails[index]
   puts "<#{mentor_id}>, <#{mentor_email}>"
 end




1. Whatâ€™s your rule of thumb for when to ask for help?
If I spend 35 minutes and don't have any idea what to do or how to move forward, then it is time to ask for some help or guidance.

2. When is an instance where you wish you would have asked for help sooner?
During my first internship when I was tasked to build a website and I had never done so before. I spent the better part of 3 days just trying to figure out what I was looking at. 

3. What information have you found crucial to include in your questions so that mentors or peers can help answer your questions quicker?
Telling the person I am asking what I think I understand about the issue at hand and asking if that is right so far.
