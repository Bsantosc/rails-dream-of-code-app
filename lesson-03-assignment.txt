1.What tables do you need to add? Decide on table names and their associations to each other and any existing tables/models.
There would have to be a total of 8 new topics to add. SQL, Data Modeling, Javascript, CSS, Automated Testing, Debugging, Web Request Cycle, HTTP. 
The associations would be "lessons' and 'topics'


2.What columns are necessary for the associations you decided on?
topics table
id 
title 


lesson_topics table
id 
lesson_id 
topic_id 

3.What other columns (if any) need to be included on the tables? What other data needs to be stored?
The topics table might include created_at and updated_at for timestamp tracking.
The lesson_topics table does not need additional columns, just the foreign keys.

4.Write out each table's name and column names with data types.
Table: topics
-----------------------
id           | integer  
title        | string  
trimester    | reference 


Table: lesson_topics (join table)
-----------------------
id          | integer  
lesson_id   | integer  
topic_id    | integer  


5.Determine the generator command you'll need to create the migration file and run the command to generate the empty migration file. Start with just the topics migration. (Hint: your filename should be create_topics)
Command:
bin/rails generate migration CreateTopics title:string
